This program draws a circle with a text box inside of it, and asks for an input in the textField to change the radius when the user presses ENTER. The circle will be redrawn to the radius the user inputted. 

Here is a quick test of the program:

Use Cases:

 - Graphical changes to a website to be quicker to implement, There is not many use cases that I can think of for this code. 

Problems:

 - The textField resizes with the radius of the circle. 

Possible Work Arounds:

 - The textField could be redrawn after the circle is drawn, seperating the two, keeping the sizing of the textField the same.
